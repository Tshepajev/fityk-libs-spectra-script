v0.1 
Initial script, undocumented.

...

v1.9
Script reads info from input files and inputs all data files defined in it. 
The data is corrected with spectal sensitivity and fitted with lines defined in the code. 
The lines have bounds between which their parameters are fitted.
The script outputs images of the fit and all parameters of all lines. 
The uncertainties of line parameters aren't to be trusted because of the complexity of the LIBS spectra.

...

v2
Unpublished.
Introduced modular input info and wrote more complex code.
Added noise estimate for weak line suppression.
Introduced moving average smoothing over pixels and datasets of a series.
Introduced custom line and dataset identifiers (names).
Introduced additional FWHM to FWHA (full width at half area) calculation.

...

v3.10
Rewrote script logic to be more foolproof and modular. 
The user-defined constants are separated from the main script.
The script processes the spectra series in chunks to limit RAM usage.
The lines are fit in a moving window of active points to save processing time. 
The lines outside the window are locked.
The script reads in input info files with custom LUA code for more versatility.
Wrote code that accepts spectra series in one file or multiple files (Andor Solis vs Sophi nXt).
Saves sessions after fitting.
Introduced local constants to account for changing continuum.
Introduced custom line functions (VoigtApparatus, VoigtFWHM and Rectangle).
Added more quality of life improvements (e.g. automatic output folder creation).
