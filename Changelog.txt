v1.0
Wrote script that reads all the files defined in info.txt, fits peaks and outputs peak parameters.

v1.1
Added features like initial peak center constraints and function width checking. Improved error output when locking function variables.

v1.2
Hardcoded parameter bound constraints for functions as parameter=constant1+constant2*sin(variable). Fityk had constraints for initial guessing but not for additional fitting. Now performance is significantly lower but numerical stability is higher.

v1.3
Changed guess_parameter_constructor() so that gwidth can't go negative. It improved peak detection. Wrote a code that asks whether the user wants to view only 1 experiment. If so Everything runs as usual but only that experiment gets selected and the dataset doesn't get deleted so that you can view what was the result of the output and why from the GUI. Fixed error calculation and changed gain function from polynomial to exponent. Added an option to lower the constant relative to the lowest point in data since the residues lift the constant higher than it should be.

v1.4
Added an additional multiplier column in load_info() - for backup. 

v1.5
Added pre-amp correction and point-wise multiplication for correction for e.g spectral sensitivity.
